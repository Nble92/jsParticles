# jsParticles

So this is a small application that generates particles, displays them to a screen and connects lines to neighboring particles.

jsParticles Documentation
script.js is a JavaScript file that creates a particle animation on an HTML canvas and provides audio analysis functionality. This documentation will provide an overview of the code structure, main functions, and event listeners used in the script.

Code Structure
The code can be divided into the following sections:

Variable Declarations and Element Selection: This section selects HTML elements and assigns them to variables.

Event Listeners: This section attaches event listeners to specific events, such as the change event on the file input.

Audio Initialization: This section initializes the audio-related components, including the audio context, audio source, and analyzer.

Particle Animation: This section defines the Particle class and includes functions for particle movement, drawing, and collision detection.

Canvas and Animation Setup: This section sets up the canvas element and initializes variables for the animation.

Mouse Interaction: This section includes event listeners for mouse movement, resizing, and mouseout events.

Helper Functions: This section includes various helper functions used within the script.

Animation Loop and Initialization: This section defines the animate() function and initializes the particle animation.

Functions and Event Listeners
The following functions and event listeners are present in the script:

file.addEventListener('change', function() {...}): This event listener triggers when a file is selected for upload. It loads the audio file, creates an audio context, connects the audio source to an analyzer, and sets up the necessary components for audio analysis.

Particle: This class represents a particle in the animation. It has properties such as position, direction, size, and color. Methods are provided for drawing, updating, and resetting the particle.

restartGame(): This function resets the game state, including the background, points, and particles.

init(): This function initializes the particle animation by creating instances of the Particle class and populating the particlesArray.

animate(): This function serves as the animation loop. It clears the canvas, updates particle positions, draws particles, and connects nearby particles with lines.

start(): This function starts the animation and game. It calls init(), checks the active flag, and starts the animation if it's active. If the animation is not active (game over), it triggers the restartGame() function.

incrementPoints(): This function increments the points variable and updates the point counter displayed on the page.

Usage and Customization
To use the jsParticles animation in your project:

Include the script.js file in your HTML document.

Make sure the HTML file contains the necessary elements referenced in the script, such as the audio container, file upload input, canvas, and other related elements.

Customize the behavior and appearance of the animation by modifying the code within the appropriate sections, such as adjusting particle properties, canvas dimensions, event listeners, or colors.

Customize or extend the functionality by adding additional functions, event listeners, or modifying existing code to suit your requirements.

Run your HTML file in a web browser and interact with the animation according to the defined behavior.

Future state is a game where you go through the lines to get points and the balls end the game.
